             <p>This year California was hit with excessive amounts of rainfall. As a result, many flooding events occurred in Merced which caused damage to homes,	infrastructure, crops, leading to the displacement of people, loss of livelihoods, and a strain on the local economy. Specifically in Bear Creek, Merced, the impact was unprecedented, affecting thousands in the area. </p>
